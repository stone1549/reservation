# reservation

A simple hotel reservation app made with React Native and GraphQL (Apollo).

## Limitations

iOs only

Currently hardcoded to connect to reservation-service at localhost:4000.

Ignorant of timezones. Days are displayed and input in the device TZ. 

No logging, no comments, no tests, no metrics, no security, minimal error handling.

## Run

yarn

react-native run-ios
